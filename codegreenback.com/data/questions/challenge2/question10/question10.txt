<div>Today is Harry’s birthday and he is looking for his purse to give treat to his friends. As usual, he's unable to find his purse and Harry has to follow a sequence of N instructions to reach it.</div><div>Initially, Harry is standing in the cell (0,0) of a two-dimensional grid. The sequence of instructions is given as a string S. If we denote Harry's current cell by (x,y), each character of S corresponds to an instruction as follows:</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'L' means to go left, i.e. to the cell (x−1,y)</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'R' means to go right, i.e. to the cell (x+1,y)</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'U' means to go up, i.e. to the cell (x,y+1)</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'D' means to go down, i.e. to the cell (x,y−1)</div><div>In addition, Harry should never perform multiple consecutive moves along the same axis of the grid. If there are multiple consecutive instructions to move along the same axis (left/right or up/down), he should perform only the first of these moves.<br><br></div><div>Find the cell (x,y) which contains the purse so that you become his friend and Harry can give you treat as well.</div>
