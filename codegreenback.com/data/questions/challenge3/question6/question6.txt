<div>&nbsp;<br>As a result of excessive pollution the nature decides to clean up itself with the help of Code Green Back.<br><br></div><div>The nature finds out that there are 26 types of elements present in hazardous pollutants at the environment which is to be eradicated.<br><br></div><div>The pollutants are named as ‘alastic’,’blastic’,’clastic’……….’ plastic’,’qlastic’……..’ylastic’ and ‘zlastic’.<br><br></div><div>You are given a String S with length N .There are N pollutants (numbered 1 through N) and for each i&nbsp; , the i-th pollutant comprises of exactly one element named ‘Silastic’ (i.e. “plastic” with the first letter replaced by the i-th character of S).<br><br></div><div>You should answer Q queries .In each query:<br><br></div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are given an integer C denoting the number of available Chambers.</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each Chamber has an infinite capacity, but with the restriction that two pollutants containing with the same type of element cannot stay in the same Chamber.</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is also a <em>pending queue</em> with an infinite capacity and there are no restrictions on which pollutants can be in the pending queue.</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Initially, the Chambers and pending queue are empty.</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each of the N pollutants should be placed in either the pending queue or one of the Chambers.</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since Code Green Back is busy finding a way to setup the servers even more powerful , So they ask Prasanna&nbsp; to find a way to place the people in the pending queue and Chambers such that the number of pollutants in the pending queue is the smallest possible.</div><div>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help Prasanna find the size of the pending queue in that case.</div>
