<div>Everyone goes behind algorithm! Which is not bad,but yet programming is not all about mugging up data structures and algorithm.<br>Lets give some time for our Mental Ability too!<br><br>You are given a task where you will be given a sequence of 'n' distinct integers.&nbsp;<br>You will have to take the first three elements of the sequence ,find the median among the three and remove it.<br>Do the task until only three elements remain in the sequence.<br><br>What will the final sequence be at the end?<br><br><br><br>Hint: Sometimes,using normal Mathematics could be useful in solving competitive programming.</div>
